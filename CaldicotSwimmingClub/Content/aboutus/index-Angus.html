		We are run by a committee and club coaches who operate on a voluntary basic. The committee is elected every year at the AGM held in January/February; existing officers may be re-elected or new nominations for office made. Any adult member or parent/guardian of existing members may stand for office. For child protection reasons you will have to be submitted to a CBR check (this also applies to adult swimmers swimming at the same time as the younger members).

Caldicot Swimming Club is affiliated to the Welsh Amateur Swimming Association (Swim Wales) and as such all members must be registered with Swim Wales within one month of joining the club. This is a requirement of the personal accident insurance which Swim Wales provides. All members must be registered prior to competing on any gala  or championship.
